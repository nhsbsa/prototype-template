## About the prototype kit

This prototype is an adapted version of the GOV.UK prototype kit. It provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes which can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.

## Design guidance

Follow further advice from GOV.UK
https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design

## Security

If you publish your prototypes online, they **must** be protected by a [username and password](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/publishing-on-heroku). This is to prevent members of the public finding prototypes and thinking they are real services.
